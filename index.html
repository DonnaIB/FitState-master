                <p>"I had lost my enthusiasm and motivation so I decided to see Colette as she is approachable, friendly and professional. My goals were the usual weight loss and increased fitness, but most of all I wanted to WANT to train again.</p>
<p>After a few sessions with Colette I noticed my body shape changing, my energy levels increased and that in itself was the motivation I needed to get my enthusiasm back again.</p>
<p>I have reached my goals but will continue to train with Colette as I want to push myself further and I know that with her support and expertise I will be able to achieve anything I put my mind and body to!!"</p>
<p>Colette's sessions are geared to my needs and she always comes up with different things to do in each session which makes them more interesting and also FUN!"</p>

<p>"I wanted to return to a level of fitness that I'd enjoyed in the past but needed someone to motivate me and work with, and Colette has been brilliant.</p>
<p>Sessions have been balanced perfectly between muscle groups and cardio, very quickly I felt fitter, healthier and stronger. I look forward to my workouts, they are always enjoyable as well as productive. </p>
<p>Colette is very intuitive and motivational, I've had great results and I always leave a session feeling I've been worked hard but never with a sense of dread for the next one. I'd highly recommend her if you're looking for a personal trainer as she gives sound advice, has the ability to help you get the best out of your efforts and is a lovely person to spend time with."</p>

<p>"I had a major wake-up call during a routine check-up. My GP told me that my blood pressure was too high, as was my cholesterol, and my blood sugar level suggested I was on the verge of developing Type 2 Diabetes,</p>
<p>I knew that I had been riding my luck for a while in that I ate too much food, drank far too much alcohol and did no exercise whatsoever. I knew I had to change and get fit!</p>
<p>I booked in for some personal training with Colette and within a few sessions I was feeling the benefits of exercise and the dietary advice she gave me. I even began to enjoy the exertion!</p>
<p>Several months on I am healthier, happier and more energised than I have been in years, and the other good news is that my GP has now told me that my blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels are all back to a normal, acceptable level."</p>

<p>Thanks to Colette I lost 20kg (3+ stone) and now feel much healthier and more active.</p>
